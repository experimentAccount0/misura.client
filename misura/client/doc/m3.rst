|m| 3 Data Import
==================================

|m| 4 can access data acquired from measurement instruments operated by previous |m| 3 software. 
By enabling the |m| 3 data import function, you can open any |m| 3 database, navigate through stored tests and get a preview of images, and convert the requested tests to the latest |m| file format. 

Once the test data has been converted and stored into the newer format, it can be opened and used exactly as any other |m| file, taking advantage of nice vector plotting, flexible data storage, reporting, and advanced math operations. 

.. hint:: The M3 data import function works only on |win| OS.
